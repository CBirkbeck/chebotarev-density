# Chebotarev's theorem: abelian case

For an abelian Galois extension `L/K` of number fields and any
`σ ∈ Gal(L/K)`, the Dirichlet density of primes `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` (unramified in
`L`) whose Frobenius equals `σ` is `1 / |Gal(L/K)|`.

The proof reduces to the cyclotomic case by *crossing with cyclotomic
extensions* (Chebotarev's original technique). For `m` coprime to the
discriminant of `L`, the field `L(μ_m)` is Galois over `K` with
`Gal(L(μ_m)/K) ≅ G × H` where `H = Gal(K(μ_m)/K) ⊆ (ℤ/mℤ)^×`. For `τ ∈ H`
with `|G| | ord(τ)`, the subgroup `⟨(σ, τ)⟩` has trivial intersection with
`G × {1}`, so its fixed field `F` satisfies `F(μ_m) = L(μ_m)` — making
`L(μ_m)/F` cyclotomic. The cyclotomic case applied to `L(μ_m)/F` and
`(σ, τ)` gives
`δ_F(primes P with σ_P = (σ, τ)) = 1/(|G| · |H|)`, and the (cyclic)
reduction lifts this through `F/K` to a lower-density bound on the primes
of `K` with Frobenius `σ`. Summing over `τ ∈ H_n = {τ : n | ord(τ)}`,

  δ_inf,K({𝔭 : σ_𝔭 = σ}) ≥ |H_n| / (|G| · |H|).

As `m` varies (chosen via Dirichlet's theorem to satisfy `m ≡ 1 mod n^k` for
large `k`), `|H_n|/|H| → 1`, so `δ_inf ≥ 1/|G|`. Summing over `σ ∈ G` then
forces equality.

## Main results

* `Chebotarev.chebotarev_abelian` — the density of primes
  of `K` unramified in an abelian extension `L/K` with Frobenius equal to
  `σ` is `1/|Gal(L/K)|`.

Decomposed per Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2 (p. 143–144). Source quote
(verbatim, p. 143):

> "Choose m ≥ 1 not dividing the discriminant of L so that H =
> Gal(L(μ_m)/L) is isomorphic to (ℤ/mℤ)^× via the mod m cyclotomic

> (σ,τ) ∈ G × H. Then δ_inf(S_σ) = Σ_{τ∈H} δ_inf(S_{σ,τ})."

And (p. 144):
> "Now suppose that |G| divides the order of τ. Then ⟨(σ,τ)⟩ ∩ (G × {1})
> = 1, which implies that L(μ_m) is given by adjoining μ_m to F =

/-! ### Cyclotomic-crossing core `exists_cyclotomicCrossing_fibres` (Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2)

Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2 cyclotomic-crossing core (p. 144). For `m ≥ 1` and `σ ∈ G`,
there is a family of prime sets `S_{σ,τ}` of `K` indexed by `τ ∈ H_n(m) =
{τ : (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ // |G| ∣ ord τ}`, pairwise disjoint, each contained in the Frobenius
fibre `S_σ`, and each of Dirichlet density exactly `1/(|G|·|H(m)|)` (with
`H(m) = (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ`).
This is the substantive geometric content of the crossing: introduce the compositum
`M = L(μ_m)` (`Gal(M/K) ≅ G × H` via the mod-`m` cyclotomic character, valid since `m`
coprime to `disc L` makes `L` and `K(μ_m)` linearly disjoint over `K`). For each such
`τ`, the subgroup `⟨(σ,τ)⟩` meets `G × {1}` trivially
(`cyclic_subgroup_meets_G_times_one_trivially`), so `M = F(μ_m)` with
`F = K(μ_m)^{⟨(σ,τ)⟩}`, making `M/F` cyclotomic; `chebotarev_cyclotomic` applied to
`M/F` at `(σ,τ)` together with the Step-1 cyclic reduction through `F/K` gives a set
`S_{σ,τ}` of primes of `K` with `Gal(M/K)`-Frobenius `(σ,τ)` of density
`1/(|G|·|H|)`. Such primes have `Gal(L/K)`-Frobenius the `G`-projection `σ`, so
`S_{σ,τ} ⊆ S_σ`; distinct `τ` give disjoint sets.

This existence statement isolates the compositum infrastructure (`Gal(L(μ_m)/K) ≅ G × H`
and the density transfer `F/K`) that is not yet available in mathlib/this project; the
`liminf` lower bound `liminf_density_S_sigma_ge_card_H_n_div_GH` is assembled sorry-free
around it (mirroring how the analytic gap is isolated in the cyclotomic case).

**Hypotheses.** The crossing is only valid at *admissible* `m`:
* `hcop : ((NumberField.discr L).natAbs).Coprime m` — coprimality of `m` to the
  discriminant of `L` is exactly what makes `L` and `K(μ_m)` linearly disjoint over `K`
  (`[K(μ_m):K] = φ(m)` and `Gal(L(μ_m)/K) ≅ G × (ZMod m)ˣ`): the intersection
  `L ∩ K(μ_m)` is unramified everywhere over `K` — the `K`-side via
  `NumberField.discr_dvd_discr` (a prime ramifying in `K(μ_m)` divides `m`, hence not
  `disc L`) and the `L`-side dually — so it is `K` itself (Minkowski).
* `hm4 : m % 4 ≠ 2` — fed verbatim into the downstream `chebotarev_cyclotomic` application
  (its `B2`-repaired signature carries this hypothesis ruling out the degenerate
  `m ≡ 2 mod 4` cyclotomic field).
As stated with `∀ m ≥ 1` the conclusion is false/unprovable at degenerate `m`; the
consumer `liminf_ratio_ge_inv_card_G` chooses `m` prime with `m ≡ 1 mod 4·|G|^k`, which
secures both hypotheses (`m % 4 = 1`; a prime exceeding `|disc L|` is coprime to it). -/
/-! #### Internal decomposition of `exists_cyclotomicCrossing_fibres`

The crossing's geometric content is isolated in the *tagged-family* master leaf
`exists_crossing_family_tagged` below: it produces the per-`τ` fibre sets `S_{σ,τ}` of `K`
*together with a single global tag* `t : Ideal (𝓞 K) → (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ` recording the
`H`-component of each prime's `Gal(M/K) = G × H`-Frobenius. The tag makes distinct-`τ` fibres
disjoint (a prime has one well-defined `M`-Frobenius), so `exists_cyclotomicCrossing_fibres`
reduces to that master leaf by a generic *distinct-tags ⟹ pairwise-disjoint* argument
(`pairwiseDisjoint_of_tag`), with no further geometry.

The master leaf is in turn intended to be discharged from the following five TRUE
infrastructure leaves (Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2, p. 144), each independently attackable and
stated against the compositum `M = L(μ_m)` (carrier `CyclotomicField m L` with its
`K`-algebra/scalar-tower structure). They are pinned here as the decomposition targets:

* `cyclotomicField_finrank_eq` (C2a) — `[K(μ_m):K] = φ(m)` from `hcop` (the deep
  ramification/Minkowski input: a prime ramifying in `K(μ_m)` divides `m`, hence is coprime
  to `disc L`, so `K ∩ L = K` and `Gal(K(μ_m)/K) ≅ (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ` has full order `φ(m)`).
* `gal_compositum_prod_iso` (C1) — `Gal(M/K) ≅ G × Gal(M/L)` via the restriction-pair, the
  linear-disjointness `G × H` splitting (uses the degree count C2a / `hcop`).
* `compositum_isCyclotomic_over_fixedField` (C3) — for any `g ∈ Gal(M/K)` the fixed field
  `F = M^⟨g⟩` has `M/F` cyclotomic; applied at `g = (σ,τ)`, where the trivial meet
  `⟨(σ,τ)⟩ ∩ (G × {1}) = 1` (`cyclic_subgroup_meets_G_times_one_trivially`, needs
  `|G| ∣ ord τ`) gives `M = F(μ_m)`. **Gate-fix (2026-06-07):** the Lean encoding of
  `G × {1} = Gal(M/K(μ_m))` is `(IntermediateField.adjoin K {b | b^m=1}).fixingSubgroup`, NOT
  `ker(restrictNormalHom L)` (which is `{1} × H = Gal(M/L)`); see the C3 docstring for the
  necessity/sufficiency argument. The master leaf must supply the corrected gate.
* `frobeniusClass_proj` (C4) — a prime with `Gal(M/K)`-Frobenius `(σ,τ)` has
  `Gal(L/K)`-Frobenius the projection `σ` (restriction-compatibility of `frobeniusClass`,
  the `M/L/K`-tower analogue of `Main.arithFrobAt_restrictScalars_eq`; replicated in
  `Abelian` because `Main` imports `Abelian`).
* `density_lift_through_fixedField_repl` (C5) — the Step-1 cyclic density transfer through
  `F/K`, applied to `M/F` (so `chebotarev_cyclotomic` at `M/F` and `(σ,τ)`, density
  `1/|Gal(M/F)|` of primes of `F`, lifts to density `1/(|G|·|H|)` of primes of `K`). This is
  a verbatim replica of `Main.density_lift_through_fixedField` (stated for top field `M`):
  `Main` is below `Abelian` in the import DAG, so the lemma cannot be imported; the
  orchestrator should reconcile (move the shared statement to a common ancestor, or have
  `Main` re-export). `hm4` threads into the `chebotarev_cyclotomic` application; `hcop`
  threads into C1/C2a. -/

`m` (`hm4 : m % 4 ≠ 2`, `hcop : (disc L).natAbs.Coprime m`) and `σ ∈ G = Gal(L/K)`, there is a
single global tag `t : Ideal (𝓞 K) → (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ` — the `H`-component of the prime's
`Gal(M/K) = G × H`-Frobenius, `M = L(μ_m)` — and a family of prime sets `S_{σ,τ}` indexed by
`τ ∈ H_n = {τ : |G| ∣ ord τ}` such that:
* each `S_{σ,τ}` lies in the `σ`-Frobenius fibre of `K` (`frobeniusClass_proj`, C4);
* every prime of `S_{σ,τ}` has tag exactly `τ` (its `M`-Frobenius `H`-component);
* each `S_{σ,τ}` has Dirichlet density `1/(|G|·|H|)` (`chebotarev_cyclotomic` at `M/F` with
  `F = M^⟨(σ,τ)⟩`, C3, lifted through `F/K` by `density_lift_through_fixedField_repl`, C5).

The global tag makes the distinct-`τ` fibres disjoint (`pairwiseDisjoint_of_tag`), which is the
only extra fact `exists_cyclotomicCrossing_fibres` needs on top of this leaf.

This packages the compositum infrastructure (`gal_compositum_prod_iso` (C1),
`cyclotomicField_finrank_eq` (C2a)) and the per-`τ` density chain (C3/C4/C5); see the

/-! #### Infrastructure leaves for `exists_crossing_family_tagged` (C1–C5)

The five TRUE, independently-attackable leaves the master leaf composes (Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2,
p. 144), stated against the compositum `M = L(μ_m)`. Recommended carrier: `CyclotomicField m L`
(it carries `[IsCyclotomicExtension {m} L M]`, `[NumberField M]`, `[FiniteDimensional L M]`
automatically; its `K`-algebra/scalar-tower structure comes from `RingHom.comp` /
`IsScalarTower.of_algebraMap_eq`). The leaves below abstract `M` as a hypothesis with the
relevant instance binders so they do not depend on that carrier choice. -/

/-- **C2a — cyclotomic degree over the base** (the deep ramification/Minkowski leaf). Source
(Sharifi p. 144): "Choose `m` not dividing the discriminant of `L` so that
`H = Gal(L(μ_m)/L) ≅ (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ` … and `Gal(L(μ_m)/K) ≅ G × H`." The full order `φ(m)`
of `H = (ℤ/mℤ)ˣ` is exactly `[K(μ_m):K] = φ(m)`, equivalently irreducibility of the `m`-th
cyclotomic polynomial over `K`; this holds because `m` is coprime to `disc L` (`hcop`): a
prime ramifying in `K(μ_m)` divides `m`, hence does not divide `disc L`, so `K ∩ L` is
unramified everywhere over `K` and equals `K` (Minkowski / `NumberField.discr_dvd_discr`),
giving linear disjointness of `L` and `K(μ_m)`. **This is the isolated deep leaf.** -/

linearly disjoint over `K` and surjective by the degree count

Stated for `g ∈ Gal(M/K)` and `F = M^⟨g⟩`: then `M/F` is the `m`-th cyclotomic extension.

**Gate correction (statement-fix, 2026-06-07).** The decomposition originally gated this leaf
by `⟨g⟩ ⊓ ker(restrictNormalHom L) = ⊥`. That is FALSE-as-stated: `ker(restrictNormalHom L)`
is `Gal(M/L) = {1} × H` (the `L`-fixers), whereas Sharifi's `⟨(σ,τ)⟩ ∩ (G × {1}) = 1` is about
`G × {1} = Gal(M/K(μ_m))`, the `μ_m`-fixers. Concretely with `g = (σ,τ)`: the *stated* meet
`⟨g⟩ ⊓ ({1}×H)` is trivial iff `ord τ ∣ ord σ`, which `|G| ∣ ord τ` does NOT give; the
*correct* meet `⟨g⟩ ⊓ (G×{1})` is trivial iff `ord σ ∣ ord τ`, which `ord σ ∣ |G| ∣ ord τ`
DOES give (matching `cyclic_subgroup_meets_G_times_one_trivially`). Moreover `M = F(μ_m)`
needs exactly `⟨g⟩ ⊓ Gal(M/K(μ_m)) = ⊥` (it is necessary and sufficient: `M = F ⊔ K(μ_m)`
⟺ `fixingSubgroup(F ⊔ K(μ_m)) = ⊥` ⟺ `⟨g⟩ ⊓ K(μ_m).fixingSubgroup = ⊥`). The hypothesis is
therefore corrected to `⟨g⟩ ⊓ (adjoin K μ_m).fixingSubgroup = ⊥`, where
`adjoin K {b | b^m = 1} = K(μ_m)` is the cyclotomic subfield (its fixing subgroup is
`Gal(M/K(μ_m)) = G × {1}`). The master-leaf assembly (`exists_crossing_family_tagged`) must
supply this corrected gate at `g = (σ,τ)`: from `|G| ∣ ord τ` via
`cyclic_subgroup_meets_G_times_one_trivially` transported across the `Gal(M/K) ≅ G × H`
splitting (C1) so that `G × {1}` is identified with `(adjoin K μ_m).fixingSubgroup`.

Proof: a primitive root `ζ ∈ M` exists (from `[IsCyclotomicExtension {m} L M]`);
`adjoin K {ζ} = adjoin K {b | b^m=1} = K(μ_m)`; the corrected meet gives `F ⊔ K(μ_m) = ⊤`
(`fixingSubgroup_sup` + `fixingSubgroup_fixedField` + the Galois correspondence
`fixedField_fixingSubgroup`); hence `adjoin F {ζ} = ⊤` over `F` (`restrictScalars_adjoin_eq_sup`),
and `adjoin F {ζ}` is `{m}`-cyclotomic over `F`
(`IsPrimitiveRoot.intermediateField_adjoin_isCyclotomicExtension`), transported to `M` along
`adjoin F {ζ} = ⊤ ≃ₐ M` (`IsCyclotomicExtension.equiv`, `IntermediateField.topEquiv`).
`[IsCyclotomicExtension {m} L M]` guarantees `μ_m ⊆ M` so the adjunction makes sense. -/

unramified in `M` (hence in `L`) whose `Gal(M/K)`-Frobenius class is `(σ,τ)` — i.e. equal to
`ConjClasses.mk τM` for `τM` restricting to `σ` over `L` — has `Gal(L/K)`-Frobenius class `σ`.
This is the restriction-compatibility of `frobeniusClass` along `K ⊆ L ⊆ M`, the tower
analogue of `Main.arithFrobAt_restrictScalars_eq` (replicated in `Abelian` because `Main`
imports `Abelian`). It is what makes each crossing fibre `S_{σ,τ}` land inside the
`σ`-Frobenius fibre `S_σ`. Proof: pick `𝔓 ∣ 𝔭` in `𝓞 M`, set `σM = arithFrobAt 𝔓`; then
`IsConj σM τM` (both represent `frobeniusClass K M 𝔭`); `σM ↾ L` is an `L`-Frobenius at
`𝔓 ∩ 𝓞 L` (`isArithFrobAt_restrictNormal_repl`), so `frobeniusClass K L 𝔭 = mk (σM ↾ L)`; and

/-- **C5 — density transfer through a fixed field** (Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2 ⇒ Step 1 reuse,
p. 143–144). A verbatim replica of `Main.density_lift_through_fixedField`, restated with the
top field `M` (the compositum), so that the crossing can be assembled inside `Abelian`:
`Main` is *below* `Abelian` in the import DAG (`Main` imports `Abelian`), so the original
cannot be imported here. Given `σM ∈ Gal(M/K)`, the fixed field `E = M^⟨σM⟩`, a lift `σE`
`σM` to `Gal(M/E)`, and the cyclic-case density `1/|Gal(M/E)|` of the `σE`-Frobenius fibre of
`E`, the transfer yields density `|C|/|Gal(M/K)|` of the `σM`-Frobenius fibre of `K`. In the
crossing, `σM = (σ,τ)`, `E = F`, and `chebotarev_cyclotomic` (at the cyclotomic `M/F`, valid by
`hm4`) supplies the `_hab` input; the resulting density is `1/(|G|·|H|)`.
**Orchestrator note (enriched 2026-06-07).** This duplicates the *proven*
`Main.density_lift_through_fixedField` (Main.lean ~1152), available only by `L ↦ M` renaming.
A naive in-file replica is NOT a "small port": the proof transitively pulls in the ENTIRE
Step-1 reduction of `Main.lean` — ~18 declarations, ~1050 lines — none of which is importable
(`Main` imports `Abelian`):
  * public-form (already `(K L)`-explicit, copy verbatim with `L ↦ M`):
    `frobeniusFibre_card_eq_of_isConj`, `card_primesAbove_eq_card_carrier_mul_frobeniusFibre`,
    `count_frobenius_eq_sigma_mul_card_carrier`, `count_primes_above_with_frobenius_eq_sigma`,
    `arithFrobAt_restrictScalars_eq`;
  * private (suffix `_repl`): `univ_ratio_E_K_tendsto_one`,
    `stabilizer_intermediate_eq_top_of_frobenius`, `inertiaDeg_under_E_eq_one_of_frobenius`,

    `primeIdealZetaSum_degTwo_le`, `ramifiedBelow_finite`,
    `primeIdealZetaSum_T2_div_univ_tendsto_zero`, and the lemma itself.
**Key structural finding:** that entire chain is *Abelian-independent* — `Main`'s only use of
`Abelian` is `chebotarev_abelian` (Main.lean:1289, inside `chebotarev_density`, AFTER all the
Step-1 helpers). So the CLEAN orchestrator fix (requires editing `Main`, which this agent does
NOT own) is to MOVE `density_lift_through_fixedField` + its Step-1 dependency block to a module
strictly below `Abelian` (a new `CebotarevDensity/FixedFieldTransfer.lean` imported by both, or
relocate into `Frobenius`), then DELETE this replica and have the master leaf call the shared
lemma. Left `sorry` here rather than duplicate ~1050 verified lines unverifiably (the project
`lake build` was concurrently broken in `ForMathlib/IdealCongruenceCount.lean`). -/

/-- Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2 — partial **lower bound** on `δ_inf(S_σ)`
coming from one choice of cyclotomic crossing modulus `m`. Source quote
(p. 144): "δ_inf(S_σ) ≥ |H_n|/(|G|·|H|)".

Sketch: for each `τ ∈ H_n` (i.e., `|G| ∣ ord(τ)`), apply the cyclotomic
case to `L(μ_m)/F` where `F = K(μ_m)^{⟨(σ,τ)⟩}`; this yields density
`1/(|G|·|H|)` of primes of `K` whose Frobenius in `Gal(L(μ_m)/K) = G×H`
equals `(σ,τ)`. Each such prime contributes to `S_σ` (the
`K`-projection drops the `τ` component to `σ`), and the contributions
from distinct `τ` are disjoint. Summing over `τ ∈ H_n` gives the
lower bound.

**Previous form** (corrected 2026-05-28): the earlier statement claimed
`δ(S_σ) = 1/(|G|·|H|)` with the set `S_σ` (= primes with Frobenius `σ`
in `Gal(L/K)`), which was mathematically wrong — that set has density
`1/|G|` (Chebotarev abelian), not `1/(|G|·|H|)`. The actual sub-step
Sharifi uses is the per-`m` lower bound on `δ_inf(S_σ)`, captured by
the present statement.

Without `L(μ_m)` explicitly in scope, we state the conclusion of the
per-`m` summation step directly: a lower bound `|H_n(m)|/(|G|·|H(m)|)`
on the `liminf` of the density ratio for `S_σ` in `K`.

The crossing is only valid at *admissible* `m`, so this per-`m` bound carries the same
two hypotheses as `exists_cyclotomicCrossing_fibres`: `hm4 : m % 4 ≠ 2` (feeding the
repaired cyclotomic case) and `hcop : ((NumberField.discr L).natAbs).Coprime m` (the
linear-disjointness via the everywhere-unramified intersection / `discr_dvd_discr`). The
consumer `liminf_ratio_ge_inv_card_G` drives `m` along admissible primes. -/

/-! #### Number-theoretic helpers for `H_n_over_H_tends_to_one`

The proof is a direct CRT-free argument: writing `total k = φ(n^k)`,
`good k = #{τ : n ∣ ord τ}` and `bad k = #{τ : n ∤ ord τ}` in the unit group
`(ZMod (n^k))ˣ`, we bound `bad k / total k → 0` and conclude `good k / total k → 1`.
The key is a *uniform* (cyclicity-free) torsion bound `torsion_card_le`, fed at the
exponent `E = λ(n^k)`. The `p = 2` non-cyclic prime power needs no special handling:
the argument stays at the level of the relatively-negligible "bad" set. -/

/-- Per-`σ` lower bound `δ_inf(S_σ) ≥ 1/|G|`, the limit of the per-`m`
bound `liminf_density_S_sigma_ge_card_H_n_div_GH` as `m → ∞` along a sequence of
*admissible primes* `m_k ≡ 1 (mod 4·n^k)` with `m_k > |disc L|` (Dirichlet's theorem on
primes in arithmetic progression, `Nat.forall_exists_prime_gt_and_modEq`). Such `m_k`
satisfy both hypotheses of the per-`m` bound: `m_k % 4 = 1 ≠ 2`, and a prime exceeding
`|disc L|` is coprime to it. For prime `m_k`, the unit group `(ZMod m_k)ˣ` is cyclic of
exponent `m_k - 1`, and `n^k ∣ m_k - 1`, so `H_n_ratio_ge` gives
`|H_n|/|H| ≥ 1 - Σ_{p ∣ n} p^{-(k·v_p(n) - v_p(n) - 1)} → 1` as `k → ∞` (each summand
`→ 0` by `summand_tendsto`). This replaces the earlier `m = n^k` route, which is invalid
here because `n^k` need not be admissible. This is the lower half of Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2

/-- Pure real-analysis glue: a finite family `gᵢ` of functions, each with
`liminf gᵢ ≥ 1/N` (where `N` is the family size) and bounded below, whose sum
tends to `1`, must each tend to `1/N`. (The lower bounds and the sum-limit pin
every `gᵢ` to `1/N` by a pigeonhole on `liminf`/`limsup`.)

The below-boundedness hypothesis `hbelow` is genuinely needed: a finite `liminf`
lower bound alone does not force below-boundedness in a conditionally complete
order, so without it the statement is false (one `gᵢ` could dip to `-∞` while
keeping a spurious `liminf` and the sum still converging). At the only call site
(`chebotarev_abelian`) each `gᵢ` is a ratio of nonnegative Dirichlet sums, hence
`0 ≤ gᵢ`, so `hbelow` is immediate. -/

/-- **Chebotarev's theorem, abelian case** (Sharifi 7.2.2 Step 2).

For an abelian Galois extension `L/K` of number fields and any
`σ ∈ Gal(L/K)`, the Dirichlet density of primes `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` unramified in
`L` whose Frobenius equals `σ` is `1 / |Gal(L/K)|`.

**Composition**: the `|G|` fibres `S_σ` each have `liminf ≥ 1/|G|`
(`liminf_ratio_ge_inv_card_G`) and their density ratios sum to `1`
(`ratioSum_frobeniusFibres_tendsto_one`); the pigeonhole glue
`tendsto_inv_card_of_liminf_ge_of_sum_tendsto_one` forces each to the
limit `1/|G|`. -/
